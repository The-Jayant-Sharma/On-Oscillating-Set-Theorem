\section{Results}

Throughout this paper, we introduced and explored the concept of \textbf{Oscillating Subsets}. These subsets possess sufficient structural density within their supersets to preserve the convergence or divergence of the harmonic sumâ€”that is, the sum of reciprocals of the elements of the superset.

We formally defined oscillating subsets as follows:

\begin{result}
A subset $A^\circ$ is called an oscillating subset of $A$ when $A^\circ \subseteq A$ and
\[
\max \left( \del\left( \ind(A, A^\circ) \right) \right) < \infty.
\]
Here, the operator $\ind(A, A^\circ)$ returns the set of indices in $A$ corresponding to the elements that form the subset $A^\circ$. The operator $\del(k)$, defined on any finite or infinite ordered set $k$, returns the set of first-order differences between successive elements. The operator $\max$ denotes the maximum of a set; if a maximum does not exist, the supremum is considered instead.
\end{result}

We then established the following central result:

\begin{result}[Oscillating Set Theorem]
Let $A$ be an increasing infinite set, and $A^\circ \subseteq A$ an oscillating subset. Then the convergence or divergence of the sum of reciprocals over one of the sets implies the same for the other. That is,
\[
\tau(A) < \infty \iff \tau(A^\circ) < \infty \quad \text{and} \quad \tau(A) = \infty \iff \tau(A^\circ) = \infty.
\]
\end{result}

This completes our investigation and affirms the fundamental harmonic preservation property of oscillating subsets.
